Write a **while loop** that prints numbers from **10 to 1**.

---

### Question 11
Write a **do–while loop** that prints numbers from **1 to 5**.

---

### Question 12
Write a loop that prints numbers from **1 to 20**, but:
- skips numbers divisible by **3**
- stops when the number becomes **15**

---

---

## 3. Functions in JavaScript

### Question 13
Write a function with **no parameters** that prints  
`"Learning JavaScript Functions"`.

---

### Question 14
Write a function `add(a, b)` that takes two parameters and prints their sum.

---

---

### Question 16
Write a function `greet(name = "Guest")` using a **default parameter**.

---

### Question 17
Write a function `isEven(num)` that returns `true` if the number is even, otherwise `false`.

---

### Question 18
Write a function `maxOfTwo(a, b)` that returns the greater number.

---

### Question 19
Write a function that calculates the **factorial** of a number using a loop.
